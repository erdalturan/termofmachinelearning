# Terminology of Machine Learning and Artifical Inteligence
*  ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) are helpful for solving complex problems.
*  CNNs (Convolution Neural Networks) are best for solving Computer Vision-related problems.
*  RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are proficient in Natural Language Processing.
*  NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks.
*  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
*  GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) 
*  SVM (Support-vector machine)
*  AR (Auto Regresive Model)
